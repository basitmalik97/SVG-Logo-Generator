## Installation

Verify the presence of Node.js on your system by entering "node -v" in your command line. In case Node.js is not detected, you can acquire it from the Node.js website for installation. Subsequently, replicate this project's repository onto your local machine. Employ the "npm install" command to acquire the required dependencies, and further enhance your development environment by installing Jest as a devDependency using the "npm install --save-dev jest" command.

## Usage

Navigate to your recently created project directory in the terminal. Launch the application by inputting "node index.js" or simply execute the script with "npm start" within the terminal's command line. A sequence of inquiries will be presented to you before your logo is produced. Should you input an invalid color keyword or hexadecimal value, you'll receive a prompt to reattempt. Similarly, if your text exceeds 3 characters, you'll be guided to provide a valid input. Once all prompts have been satisfied with acceptable values, your fresh logo will be generated, bearing the name 'logo.svg,' within the 'examples' directory. For additional guidance, you can refer to the video provided in the description.
